U.S.A.,"August 29, 2007","This recall involves all SW-3000 2nd stage 360-degree swivels for scuba diving masks manufactured between January 2004 and February 2005. The swivel has the date stamped on its body, below the patent number. Swivels that are already repaired have an arrow stamped on the top right corner of the swivel body.","The swivel, which is attached to a diving mask, could separate while diving. This will result in a sudden loss of the diver's air supply, causing the diver to engage in emergency ascent. This poses a risk of decompression sickness due to rapid ascent or drowning.",,M&J Engineering has received one report of swivels separating from the masks while diving.

,"December 14, 2000","WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), General Electric Appliances Co., of Louisville, Ky., is voluntarily offering a free repair option in the form of a rewiring for its recalled GE and Hotpoint dishwashers. With the free rewire option, a GE-authorized technician will rewire the slide switch at no cost to consumers. This supplements the original rebate program announced October 19, 1999. The dishwashers have a slide switch that can melt and ignite, presenting a fire hazard. CPSC is aware of approximately 90 incidents associated with these dishwashers. GE manufactured 3.1 million of these dishwashers between 1983 and 1989.",,,,https://cpsc.gov/Recalls/2001/CPSC-and-GE-Announce-Free-Repair-Supplement-of-Rebate-Program-for-Recalled-Dishwashers-Recalled-Units-Still-Being-Used-Creating-Risk-of-Fire,,,,
