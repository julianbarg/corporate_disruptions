\abstract{The topic of temporality has been analyzed from multiple different angles. In this paper, we develop a working definition of corporate pace, a new concept in this field. Most previous studies of temporality focus on the time frame of decisions, or perception of time. Corporate pace on the other hand describes how frequently major changes are being implemented. When frequent swift changes take place, the content of individual decisions matters less. The fast pace becomes an important characteristic that affects the development of the firm. We argue that the fast pace can cause breakdowns of important routines, and thus define a new starting point for research on occurances of accidents and environmental impacts.}
