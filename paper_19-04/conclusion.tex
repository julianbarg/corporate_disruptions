\section{Conclusion}

We have initially obtained some interesting results, but the inclusion of a year dummy made this effect disappear. Further, the results seem to be largely driven by two outliers. Moving forward, we want to test the our results on a larger dataset to gain more certainty. Some other limitations of the dataset can be rectified. More historical data on recalls is available. Further, better merging of the dataset might make some more of the data we have already collected available for analysis. Further, we have so far removed missing cases, instead, we could manually collect the missing data. Finally, more control variables might be available and allow us to better isolate the effect of pace, for instance R\&D or a variable that similarly captures exploration. In addition, there are some alternative data sources for our independent variable, top management turnover, such as BoardEx and Capital IQ.
